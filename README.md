Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. Public Leaderboard Score 0.11701 with ONLY ONE ENTRY.


## 1 Preface
I used to rank top5% on [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

However, more than 100 entries were made to achieve this score, which means I'm actually tuning my model on the test data set. The problem of data leakage arises when you make submissions more than once.

This repo aims to tell you how to get a score of 0.11701(top10.57%) with only **ONE ENTRY**. With the help of Genetic Algorithm and Bayesian Optimization(hyperopt), this is not a lucky score achieved randomly, but a certain result we can **ALMOST SURELY** get.
